# Weather Web App

This is a weather web app that allows users to search for weather information by city name. The app fetches real-time weather data from the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) using `axios` to display the current weather, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more for any city.

## Features

- **City Search:** Users can search for weather information by entering a city name.
- **Weather Information Displayed:**
  - Current temperature (in Celsius or Fahrenheit)
  - Weather conditions (clear, cloudy, rainy, etc.)
  - Humidity and wind speed
  - Weather icon representing the current conditions
- **Real-Time Data:** The app fetches live weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **User-friendly Interface:** Easy-to-navigate UI with a clean design.

## Requirements

- Node.js (if running locally)
- Axios (for making HTTP requests)
- OpenWeatherMap API key (required for API access)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-web-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

## Files

- **`App.js`** - The main React component that handles the user interface and logic for fetching weather data.
- **`WeatherCard.js`** - Component that displays the weather details for a city.
- **`axios.js`** - Axios configuration and API request handling.
- **`.env`** - The environment file where your OpenWeatherMap API key should be stored (if applicable).

## Usage

1. Open the app in your browser.
2. Enter the name of a city in the search bar.
3. The app will fetch and display the current weather information for that city.
4. You can repeat the process to check the weather for other cities.

## API Integration

The app makes use of the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to get weather data. You'll need to sign up for a free API key, which can be added to the app to allow fetching weather data.
