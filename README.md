# Weather Web App

This is a weather web app that allows users to search for weather information by city name. The app fetches real-time weather data from the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) using `axios` to display the current weather, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more for any city.

- **User-friendly Interface:** Easy-to-navigate UI with a clean design.
